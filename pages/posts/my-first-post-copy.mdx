# Intro to code components

Hey, this is Steve, Design Educator for Framer.

In this video, I’m going to introduce you to code components: a type of component that, as its name suggests, was written using code.

Code components are one of my favorite features in Framer, but they are also one of the most complex. This video will show you what they are and what they’re for, and how you can use them in your project.

## Components

Ok, let’s talk about **components**. In Framer, components are re-usable parts of your design. Things like a button, a card, a user card, things like that.

Framer has two different types of components.

The first is a **design component**, which is an re-usable arrangement of Frames, Graphics, Text, and other components, that we can create on the canvas. If you’d like to learn about Design Components, check out our video on Design Components in the Framer Crash Course.

The second type of component is a **code component**. It’s also a re-usable arrangement of Frames, Graphics, Text and other components. However, unlike a design component, code component are written with code.

We’ll see in a moment what that looks like, and why you might want to do that, but if you just want to _use_ a code component — well, you probably already have. On the canvas, the Stack Tool, Page Tool, and all of the other interactive components — these are all code components.

You can also get code components from the store.

Here’s a code component I made — a scroll bar with a knob that shows how much of the scrolling content is actually in view.

We can drop it into a project, set it up on the canvas, and even set it up the way we want using the component’s property controls. The component — what it looks like, how it works, and even those controls — I made those things using code, but you don’t need code in order to use it.

If you’re looking for something that needs to move, interact, or just have some extra brains, and if Framer’s starter components aren’t enough, then you might start by checking the store.

To learn more about packages, check out our video on Store Packages in the Crash Course.

## Making Code Components

But hey, what about making code components yourself?

We’re not going to go very deep at all here, but even still, I should point out that code components are one of Framer’s more advanced features, and you can get a lot out of Framer without ever needing to make one of these.

If you’re just getting started, or if this just isn’t your jam, feel free to skip code components and come back to it later.

...

Hey, welcome back, let’s create a code component.

To create a code component, first select the **Assets** tab, which will show your project's assets, what are all of the components and store packages that you can drop into our project. You'll see your Design Components here, too.

To create a new asset, click on **Create Asset** button.

Enter a name for your component... and then select **Code component** as the type of asset that you want to create.

Then click on **Create**.

Here’s your new code component.

And hey, this might be your first time seeing code, either in Framer — or maybe anywhere else. If so, let’s break the ice.

Open up the **preview**.

What your see here is your component.

Now, before we do anything else, let’s have some fun.

Go into the code and change the font size from `16` to some other number.

See how the component changes in the preview?

Very interesting.

Next, change the `scale` here to `.9`.

And hover over the component in the preview.

Next, add a new line just below the curly braces here.

Write `height={300}`.

One more — after the braced `text` here, write an exclamation point or two.

You know what, maybe spend a minute playing around here. If you break the component, you can undo back to where it was before, or else just go ahead and make a new one.

#### What did we just do?

So what’s going on here?

Like the design component you made earlier, your code component can be a collection of Frames, Graphics, Text, and other content.

The big difference is that, on the canvas, you could change these things directly — or at least, visually — whereas in a code component, you use _code_ to describe what you want and how you want it to be, and the computer takes care of the rest.

For example, if you wanted to change the height a Frame on the canvas, you could just grab its bottom edge or one of its corners and start moving them around. However, in a code component, you would make that change using words and numbers that the computer knows how to understand — you know, code.

> Adds `height={400}`

I know what you’re thinking, and you’re right: writing code is a real hassle for some things, like adjusting our height here. It’s much easier to do that on the canvas. But remember, even when we’re working on the canvas, we’re still working on the computer — under the hood, it’s all code. The canvas, like any application, is just a more human-friendly way to edit that code.

So why would we use a Code Component instead of a Design Component?

Why go through the hassle of defining things in code?

Well, there are some things that you can only do in code.

- You can set up interactions, like our hover here.
- You can define animations and events.
- You can make components with multiple states, like on or off.
- And you can add Property controls, which will let you or your teammates customize your code component on the canvas.

- And, really, you can do anything you can imagine — the code you see here is the same code that powers websites, so if it works on the web, it will also work here in Framer.

So yeah, a bit of a hassle, but those things might worth the hassle.

Not everyone _loves_ to code, though I bet you’ll love what you can _do_ with code, and I’ll be you’ll be surprised at how quickly it starts making sense.

#### Doing some magic

If you’d like to go a little deeper, check out our examples projects, where you’ll find projects ready to start tweaking and changing. You can also find video tutorials here on Framer.com slash learn.

In this video, we learned about code components, which are reusable parts of your design in Framer that you can create from code.

Once again, this is Steve, Design Educator for Framer. Thanks for watching and good luck!

#### Making Design Components

First, let’s talk about how they’re made.

We’ll start with Design Components.

You create a Design Components on the canvas.

You’ll need a Frame, and you can put any content inside of that Frame.

To turn this Frame into a design component, select the Frame, right click, and select **Create Component**.

The Frame is now the **Master** for this component.

You can now create **Instances** of the Master.

You can tweak certain parts of an Instance without effecting the Master.

… but when you change parts of the Master, they’ll also change on the instance, unless you’ve tweaked them there.

If you’ve used design tools before, chances are you’ve already seen this pattern. There are a few more tricks to Design Components, so if you’re curious, check out our videos on Design Components in the Crash Course.

Ok, so that’s how you make Design Components.

How do you make code components?

I really like open-source software.

As a designer and developer, I've build a career on top of excellent open-source projects and tools. Half of what I know about software (the better half) came from reading through open-source code. And I've given back a little, too: I maintain [perfect-freehand](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-freehand), a library for generating pressure-sensitive lines, [perfect-arrows](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-arrows), a library for generating nice-looking arrows, as well as open-source apps such as [globs.design](https://globs.design) and [state-designer](https://state-designer.com).

I also like the _idea_ of open-source.

While contributing to an open-source project isn't exactly stepping outside of capitalism, it feels like a step in the right direction. I'm glad to be part of an industry where collective, mutually-interested labor is so common, accessible and practical.

Like many others, my open-source work has also brought me plenty of advantage in my career, both directly in the projects that I've been able to work on, and indirectly through what I've been able to learn and the relationships I've built outside of my regular jobs. I take those benefits seriously: keeping things balanced is part of how I keep myself interested.

No matter how great these secondary benefits are, at some point complex open-source projects need direct financial support if they're to be completed and maintained.

I work on a project named [tldraw](https://tldraw.com), a "tiny little drawing app" that is a bit more than the name implies: the shapes are all rendered in SVG using my free-hand drawing algorithm, [perfect-freehand](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-freehand); and the app includes a powerful code editor for creating and exploring shapes through code.

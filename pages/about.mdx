My name is Steve Ruiz and I'm a product designer in London.

In my work, I help design teams solve tricky user experience problems through interactive prototypes. My favorite design problems are usually related to creative tools.

## My Work

I am currently working with the team at [Play](https://www.createwithplay.com/), helping to design a mobile-first design application for iOS. I was previously working in product education at [Framer](https://framer.com/). Before that, I worked as a product designer for [Inviqa](https://inviqa.com/), [ClearScore](https://www.clearscore.com/), and [Phenomen Films](https://www.phenomentrust.org/).

## Open Source

I have also built and maintain several open source projects:

- [state-designer](https://state-designer.com/) is a state management library with its own [visual design environment](https://ide.state-designer.com/). It's based on state charts and is great for prototyping.
- [perfect-arrows](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-arrows) is a library for drawing arrows between points and shapes. It made for some fun [tweet threads](https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1283139008499986437).
- [gotcha](https://github.com/steveruizok/gotcha/) was an interactive inspection tool for Framer prototpes. You can read more about it [here](https://blog.framer.com/introducing-gotcha-for-framer-b45bb8d9da86).

## Education

I have my Masters degree in Fine Art from the University of Chicago. I used to make paintings like the one below. If you're curious, you can see more of my artwork [here](https://steveruizart.com/post/143940690557/negril-slides-gouache-ink-and-enamel-on).

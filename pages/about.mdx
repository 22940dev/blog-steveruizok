My name is Steve and I'm a product designer in London. I specialize in designing complex interactions through prototypes. I have my Masters in Fine Art from the University of Chicago.

## My Work

I am currently working with the team at [Play](https://www.createwithplay.com/).

I was previously leading product education at [Framer](https://framer.com/).

## Open Source

My side product is [State Designer](https://state-designer.com/), a state management library with a [visual design environment](https://ide.state-designer.com/). I use it for prototyping!

I also developed [perfect-arrows](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-arrows), a library for drawing arrows between points. It made for some great [tweet threads](https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1283139008499986437).

In 2017 I built [Gotcha](https://github.com/steveruizok/gotcha/), an interactive inspection tool for Framer prototpes. [Learn more](https://blog.framer.com/introducing-gotcha-for-framer-b45bb8d9da86).
